||1|| A good method for keeping your drains clear or buildups is pouring boiling water down the drain every time you use the sink. An easy solution and a great alternative to cleaning products, boiling water regularly really does work! This simple method is a great way to help wash away anything that may be collecting around the plughole or sticking in the pipes. A kettle full of hot water every day will help keep your plughole clear and prevent blocked or slow running drains.
||2|| You can expect to pay $ on average to have a blocked bathtub or shower drain cleared. Even with regular cleaning, the bathtub and shower drain pipes quickly fill with debris, including hair, dirt, and soap scum. The debris sticks to the inside pipe surfaces and forms a blockage. As this happens, you may notice water drainage slowing down. Acting fast can help you can prevent the need for clog removal services. You can manually remove hair with a snake and remove soap scum with drain cleaner.
||3|| Instead of harmful chemicals, this drain unblocker uses a gas that expands when it comes into contact with water. This generates a strong turbulence that clears drains up to  metres away by agitation, rather than pressure. It'll remove blockages caused by hair, soap build-up, paper, grease and food particles in seconds. You can use it on blocked or slow-flowing sinks, basins, baths or shower trays. And with the optional plunger head, it can even clear blocked and slow-flowing toilets.
||4|| In our experience, almost all blockages are caused by accidental damage. But in a few cases, householders cause a blockage themselves – for example by flushing nappies, wipes, fat, grease or detergent into the sewage system – and this would not be covered as accidental damage. Our Drain Unblock and CCTV Inspection service will determine the problem, and if it’s not accidental and you cannot make a claim, we can still arrange to get the work done for you by our approved contractors. You pay us for this yourself, but we will tell you the cost before work starts.
||5|| How is a plumber or drainer going to cost you? Some plumbers or drainers may charge a call-out fee, which is an additional fee to their hourly rate. A call-out fee might range from $ to $, with hourly rates anywhere from $ - $ depending on where you live. Expect to pay an emergency call out fee if you need a plumber over a weekend or after hours. The cost of this varies, with some plumbers charging their usual hourly rates, though most will charge extra for call-outs at odd hours.
||6|| Cut plastic waste pipes with a hacksaw, then remove the burrs inside and out with a half-round file before you fix them. Solvent-weld fittings are neat but permanent - so while they're ideal on visible pipework, it's better to use compression fittings under and behind your sinks so you can take them apart again for cleaning and unblocking. When you run pipes along an interior or exterior wall, it's a good idea to hold them in place with waste pipe clips - which you can get in lots of different colours and sizes. Use wall plugs and screws to attach the clips to a masonry wall, or hollow-wall fixings on plasterboard. Don't forget to check for hidden pipes and cables before you drill.
||7|| If you prefer using natural drain cleaners, a baking soda and white vinegar solution is often the most effective option. Pour half a cup of bicarbonate of soda into the pipes and follow it with half a cup of vinegar. This combination should start bubbling and help clear any blockages around your plughole. After you’ve given it  minutes or so to work, it is important to follow the solution with boiling water to wash it completely out of your drains.
||8|| If you find that there are more than just one clog in our home, then your draining problem may be more serious. If this is the case, then more than likely there is a blockage in your main line. Call a professional immediately, and stop using all water using your main line. The cost to clean a sewer main line is around $. This can seem expensive, but when compared to a repair for a sewer main line you will want to take care of it now. The cost to repair or replace a main sewer line is approximately $,. This is far more expensive than a sewer main line cleaning project, but necessary for you and your home’s health.
||9|| If these combinations aren’t successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a common household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal off the second side with a wet cloth or a stopper. You’ll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with enough water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge vigorously several times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.
||10|| When customers call us with a blocked drain, it can often be confused with us thoroughly cleaning/or clearing the drainage system. Unblocking a drain will consist of us locating the blockage and attempting to remove the obstruction, to restore the flow of the drains. Clearing/cleaning the drains is a maintenance service - the drains will be jetted to eliminate waste, scale, silt, grease, fat and just about everything else from the drain walls.
||11|| Although it is usually a good idea, it's not always necessary to hire a professional to resolve a blocked drain. You may be able to remove blockages in a single pipe with a plumbing snake. When the blockage is affecting multiple plumbing fixtures, however, then there is probably a clog in the main sewage. If you suspect this problem, immediately stop using your water supply and contact an emergency drain cleaning company.
||12|| Equipment rental companies and hardware stores allow you to borrow handheld drain snakes and machine augers for a daily, weekly or monthly fee. Handheld drain snakes range from $ to $ a day. The weekly and monthly rate greatly decreases the daily cost, so choose one of those options if your project will take more than a day. If you go this route, your handheld drain snake rental will cost around $ a week or up to $ a month.
||13|| Our vans contain high powered water jetting machines. Primarily, they expel water through a jetting hose and nozzle at extremely high pressures. As the water is discharged at enormous pressure, it propels the hose down the drain line (with the hose being correctly handled). Rear jetting nozzles propel the hose to the blockage and once located will break and dislodge the blockage, restoring flow.
||14|| In many cases, the clogged drain will be a relatively simple fix. Using a long, thin tool to snake the drain, plumbers can break up and pull out the blockage in the pipe in just a few minutes. In these cases, the cost of hiring a plumber will be minimal, but the expense will go up quite a bit for those who call a plumber outside of normal business hours.
||15|| Simple blockages that are located above the s-trap can be cleared without specialist machinery. Plumbers grade caustic acid (requires a plumbing licence to purchase) or a heavy duty plunger is normally enough to resolve the problem. Blocked drains that fall within this category include a shower blocked by hair, a kitchen sink blocked by food scraps or a toilet clogged with organic matter such as excess toilet paper.
||16|| When it comes to clogged pipes or any plumbing issue, it is best to call a professional. At the end of the day, they have the most experience and the right tools to do the job correctly. This may cost you money, but it will save you time and a huge mess to deal with at home. Your plumber should have plenty of knowledge and experience with a simple fix like this. Make sure they are insured and licensed to do this work. Accidents and injuries are unlikely, but it is best to be safe.
||17|| To have a plumber snake a main sewage line, you can expect to pay between $ and $. The price of clearing a main line varies quite a bit based on the severity of the blockage, the distance snaked, and the amount of time involved. While it's possible to rent an industrial snake for $ to $, this is an unpleasant job that you should probably leave to a professional.
||18|| Enzymatic drain cleaners contain bacteria cultures and concentrated enzymes that react with organic residue that builds up on sewer pipes, dissolving the residue to help prevent slow-running drains. Most enzymatic drain cleaners are intended for general maintenance to maintain proper flow and are not intended to clear fully clogged drain pipes.[citation needed]
||19|| Sydney blocked drains can occur for any number of reasons and the right solution depends entirely on the cause. A simple blockage caused by organic debris, such as food scraps in the kitchen sink, can be quick and cheap to fix. A blockage in your sewer pipes caused by a solid mass of wet-wipes and grease, will be more difficult and expensive to resolve.
||20|| The best way to fight clogs in your drain is by preventing them from happening. It’s better to deal with this now, rather than letting the issue become bigger and more damaging. A common option to break down and prevent any clogs is to pour chemical drain cleaner down your drains every couple months. Try to find a non-corrosive drain cleaner to avoid potential pipe corrosion.
||21|| Sometimes, it can be tricky grabbing hold of pieces of hair and other debris that has become stuck around your plughole. Using tweezers is a great option and if you want fast results, they are the ideal solution. You can use your tweezers to carefully and gently fish out any hair, soap pieces, and stuck debris that has built up around your plughole. It may seem like an odd approach in how to clean plugholes, but it is widely regarded as the fastest and easiest way to clear your plughole.
||22|| Drain jetting is an effective & efficient method of clearing drains. Traditionally, it would typically have been performed with standard drain rods. However, drain rods have fundamental flaws, such as being unable to properly navigate around corners or reach other difficult to clear areas. Our high-pressure jetting equipment allows us to navigate around bends and apply far more pressure than manual rods on the blockage.
||23|| "A member of the team arrived well within the time slot arranged and offered a complete all round service and couldn't have been more helpful. Although the job was much more involved than I first thought, he was able to completely clear the obstruction which was some way along the main drain. I have never felt that I have wanted to leave feedback in the past for any work I've had done but in this case I have no hesitation. First class service."
||24|| If your sink, basin or bath becomes slow to drain (or stops draining completely) there's probably a blockage somewhere in your waste pipe. Common causes are grease in the trap, or fibres caught below the grid on the plug-hole. If the water doesn't drain away at all, you've got a complete blockage - which means there must be an obstruction in the waste pipe. You can try a range of methods to sort this out.
||25|| Hiring a plumber to clear a sink blockage costs a flat fee of $ to $. If problems arise, your repair bills could start climbing, however, as charges for minimum labor amounts and call-out fees are standard. Therefore, it is often far cheaper to attempt to clear a simple drain blockage yourself.
||26|| Sometimes called an auger, this handy tool can clear clogs that may be stuck further down the system. You’ll have to disassemble the drainpipe and P-trap that runs underneath the kitchen sink to expose the “stub pipe” or “stubout” that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to break up the clog.
||27|| "Would thoroughly recommend this company. From the first phone call, Happy Drains were polite, courteous and efficient. The job was completed in  minutes. Mark was fantastic in finding the problem and went above and beyond to remove the roots blocking the drain. He also checked our other drains and jetted all the debris. I was given a choice of paying by cash, cheque or online. The price was excellent. I would certainly use this company again. Mark was a great tradesman."
||28|| For small clogs or blockages, a good removal method is to use commercial drain cleaners. These unblocking products help get rid of any small debris build-ups that are not washing away naturally with the water flow. It’s your choice whether you use chemical cleaners or prefer eco-friendly products, both are just as effective.
||29|| Many plumbing issues involve stoppages and clogged drains or pipes. If all of your DIY efforts don't work, stoppages in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets may be covered by an American Home Shield plumbing warranty depending on the cause. When you encounter a covered plumbing problem, no matter how big or how small, contact AHS for help.
||30|| Basic handheld, manually or drill-activated plumbing snakes typically cost around $, but they only reach up to  feet. These work best for minor blockages that are located fairly close to the basin or toilet. If you need to resolve this type of clog, you can pick up this style plumbing snake at the hardware store.
