A kettle full of hot water every day will help keep your plughole clear and prevent blocked or slow running drains."
drainblockedclear,drainblockedclear,38.0,Cost to Clear Blocked Drain in Bathtub or Shower,"You can expect to pay $ on average to have a blocked bathtub or shower drain cleared. Even with regular cleaning, the bathtub and shower drain pipes quickly fill with debris, including hair, dirt, and soap scum. The debris sticks to the inside pipe surfaces and forms a blockage. As this happens, you may notice water drainage slowing down. Acting fast can help you can prevent the need for clog removal services. You can manually remove hair with a snake and remove soap scum with drain cleaner."
drainunblock,drainunblock,35.0,Top tip - Instant drain unblocker,"Instead of harmful chemicals, this drain unblocker uses a gas that expands when it comes into contact with water. This generates a strong turbulence that clears drains up to  metres away by agitation, rather than pressure. It'll remove blockages caused by hair, soap build-up, paper, grease and food particles in seconds. You can use it on blocked or slow-flowing sinks, basins, baths or shower trays. And with the optional plunger head, it can even clear blocked and slow-flowing toilets."
drainblockage,drainblockage,34.0,What if my drain blockage is my own fault?,"In our experience, almost all blockages are caused by accidental damage. But in a few cases, householders cause a blockage themselves – for example by flushing nappies, wipes, fat, grease or detergent into the sewage system – and this would not be covered as accidental damage. Our Drain Unblock and CCTV Inspection service will determine the problem, and if it’s not accidental and you cannot make a claim, we can still arrange to get the work done for you by our approved contractors. You pay us for this yourself, but we will tell you the cost before work starts."
costplumber,costplumber,34.0,The cost of hiring a plumber,"How is a plumber or drainer going to cost you? Some plumbers or drainers may charge a call-out fee, which is an additional fee to their hourly rate. A call-out fee might range from $ to $, with hourly rates anywhere from $ - $ depending on where you live. Expect to pay an emergency call out fee if you need a plumber over a weekend or after hours. The cost of this varies, with some plumbers charging their usual hourly rates, though most will charge extra for call-outs at odd hours."
pipe,pipe,34.0,"Cutting, jointing and fixing waste pipes","Cut plastic waste pipes with a hacksaw, then remove the burrs inside and out with a half-round file before you fix them. Solvent-weld fittings are neat but permanent - so while they're ideal on visible pipework, it's better to use compression fittings under and behind your sinks so you can take them apart again for cleaning and unblocking. When you run pipes along an interior or exterior wall, it's a good idea to hold them in place with waste pipe clips - which you can get in lots of different colours and sizes. Use wall plugs and screws to attach the clips to a masonry wall, or hollow-wall fixings on plasterboard. Don't forget to check for hidden pipes and cables before you drill."
sodabaking,sodabaking,32.0,Baking Soda Vinegar Solution,"If you prefer using natural drain cleaners, a baking soda and white vinegar solution is often the most effective option. Pour half a cup of bicarbonate of soda into the pipes and follow it with half a cup of vinegar. This combination should start bubbling and help clear any blockages around your plughole. After you’ve given it  minutes or so to work, it is important to follow the solution with boiling water to wash it completely out of your drains."
cleaningmainclean,cleaningmainclean,31.0,Main Line Cleaning,"If you find that there are more than just one clog in our home, then your draining problem may be more serious. If this is the case, then more than likely there is a blockage in your main line. Call a professional immediately, and stop using all water using your main line. The cost to clean a sewer main line is around $. This can seem expensive, but when compared to a repair for a sewer main line you will want to take care of it now.

plunger,plunger,31.0,. Plunger,"If these combinations aren’t successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a common household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal off the second side with a wet cloth or a stopper. You’ll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with enough water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge vigorously several times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water."
draindrainsclear,draindrainsclear,28.0,Cleaning/clearing drains and unblocking? What is the difference?,"When customers call us with a blocked drain, it can often be confused with us thoroughly cleaning/or clearing the drainage system. Unblocking a drain will consist of us locating the blockage and attempting to remove the obstruction, to restore the flow of the drains. Clearing/cleaning the drains is a maintenance service - the drains will be jetted to eliminate waste, scale, silt, grease, fat and just about everything else from the drain walls."
drainplumberclogged,drainplumberclogged,28.0,When to Call a Plumber for a Clogged Drain,"Although it is usually a good idea, it's not always necessary to hire a professional to resolve a blocked drain. You may be able to remove blockages in a single pipe with a plumbing snake. When the blockage is affecting multiple plumbing fixtures, however, then there is probably a clog in the main sewage. If you suspect this problem, immediately stop using your water supply and contact an emergency drain cleaning company."

If you go this route, your handheld drain snake rental will cost around $ a week or up to $ a month."
drainclearblockage,drainclearblockage,27.0,How does a drain jetting machine clear the blockage?,"Our vans contain high powered water jetting machines. Primarily, they expel water through a jetting hose and nozzle at extremely high pressures. As the water is discharged at enormous pressure, it propels the hose down the drain line (with the hose being correctly handled). Rear jetting nozzles propel the hose to the blockage and once located will break and dislodge the blockage, restoring flow."
draincostcleaning,draincostcleaning,27.0,Drain Cleaning Cost,"In many cases, the clogged drain will be a relatively simple fix. Using a long, thin tool to snake the drain, plumbers can break up and pull out the blockage in the pipe in just a few minutes. In these cases, the cost of hiring a plumber will be minimal, but the expense will go up quite a bit for those who call a plumber outside of normal business hours."
sinkcloggedkitchen,sinkcloggedkitchen,27.0,$ to $ to repair a simple clogged toilet or kitchen sink,"Simple blockages that are located above the s-trap can be cleared without specialist machinery.

drainclean,drainclean,24.0,Enzymatic drain cleaners[edit],"Enzymatic drain cleaners contain bacteria cultures and concentrated enzymes that react with organic residue that builds up on sewer pipes, dissolving the residue to help prevent slow-running drains. Most enzymatic drain cleaners are intended for general maintenance to maintain proper flow and are not intended to clear fully clogged drain pipes.[citation needed]"
drainblocked,drainblocked,24.0,Blocked drain causes,"Sydney blocked drains can occur for any number of reasons and the right solution depends entirely on the cause. A simple blockage caused by organic debris, such as food scraps in the kitchen sink, can be quick and cheap to fix. A blockage in your sewer pipes caused by a solid mass of wet-wipes and grease, will be more difficult and expensive to resolve."
preventhow,preventhow,24.0,How To Prevent Clogs,"The best way to fight clogs in your drain is by preventing them from happening. It’s better to deal with this now, rather than letting the issue become bigger and more damaging.

Try to find a non-corrosive drain cleaner to avoid potential pipe corrosion."

It may seem like an odd approach in how to clean plugholes, but it is widely regarded as the fastest and easiest way to clear your plughole."
drain,drain,23.0,Drain Jetting,"Drain jetting is an effective & efficient method of clearing drains. Traditionally, it would typically have been performed with standard drain rods. However, drain rods have fundamental flaws, such as being unable to properly navigate around corners or reach other difficult to clear areas. Our high-pressure jetting equipment allows us to navigate around bends and apply far more pressure than manual rods on the blockage."

Although the job was much more involved than I first thought, he was able to completely clear the obstruction which was some way along the main drain. I have never felt that I have wanted to leave feedback in the past for any work I've had done but in this case I have no hesitation. First class service."""
blockedclearsink,blockedclearsink,23.0,How to clear a blocked sink,"If your sink, basin or bath becomes slow to drain (or stops draining completely) there's probably a blockage somewhere in your waste pipe. Common causes are grease in the trap, or fibres caught below the grid on the plug-hole. If the water doesn't drain away at all, you've got a complete blockage - which means there must be an obstruction in the waste pipe. You can try a range of methods to sort this out."

You’ll have to disassemble the drainpipe and P-trap that runs underneath the kitchen sink to expose the “stub pipe” or “stubout” that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to break up the clog."

From the first phone call, Happy Drains were polite, courteous and efficient. The job was completed in  minutes. Mark was fantastic in finding the problem and went above and beyond to remove the roots blocking the drain. He also checked our other drains and jetted all the debris. I was given a choice of paying by cash, cheque or online. The price was excellent. I would certainly use this company again. Mark was a great tradesman."""
